Hey! My name is Seva.  

## About

I’m an engineer—DevOps, SRE, Head of Infrastructure, Platform Engineer—basically, any title that translates to “gets things done.” I’ve had the privilege of working with companies like Grammarly, Ring, Endury, Kuna, Let’s Enhance, and a few others you’ve probably heard of.

Oh, and I’ve dabbled in product management and CPO-ing because why not? It was interesting. 

In my free time, I enjoy mentoring and giving speeches.

What do I love most? Building stuff and keeping it running like clockwork, i.e., development and monitoring.
